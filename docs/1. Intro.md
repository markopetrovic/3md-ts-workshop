## What is TypeScript?
Typescript is an open source language and a statically typed superset of JavaScript that extends 
the capabilities of JavaScript by introducing additional features and strict type checking. This reduces the chance of runtime errors in production, 
and also allows us to more confidently refactor code in large-scale applications. 
TypeScript also improves developer experience via type-based auto-completion in IDEs.

### Features and advantages

- Static Typing: TypeScript enforces strong typing, catching type-related errors during development and reducing bugs in production.
- Enhanced IDE Support: TypeScript provides improved tooling and autocompletion, enabling developers to write code more efficiently. (code completion, inline documentation, etc)
- Advanced Language Features: TypeScript supports features like classes, interfaces, modules, private fields facilitating cleaner and more structured code.
- ECMAScript Compatibility: TypeScript is designed to align with the evolving ECMAScript standards, allowing developers to leverage the latest JavaScript features while maintaining backward compatibility.
- Rich Type System: TypeScript offers a rich type system that includes built-in types, union types, generics, and more, providing increased flexibility and code expressiveness.
- Can be used for frontend and backend development
- Types from 3rd party libraries can be added via type definition files (.d.ts files)

### Why use TypeScript?
- Static typing and type inference
- Early detection of errors
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- Refactoring and tooling support
- Team Collaboration


### Dynamic vs Static Types
- Dynamic types are resolved at runtime
- Static types are resolved at compile time
- TypeScript is a static type checker
- JavaScript is a dynamic type checker
